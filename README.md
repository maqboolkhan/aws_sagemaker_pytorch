# aws_sagemaker_pytorch
A repository to demonstrate how to use AWS Sagemaker to train and deploy custom deep learning model using Pytorch.

Please check `prac.ipynb` as I heavily commented the notebook. You just need to know how to create a notebook with Amazon Sagemaker and after creating the notebook you either follow instructions given in `prac.ipynb` or just simply upload all the content of this repository to your Sagemaker Jupyter and execute and learn ;)

You can learn [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0vC31OXt-g&list=PLRKzsBn5cc9GrfpiR-FSGyJoRKRoQjBBQ&index=2) about how to create Sagemaker notebook instance.

Thanks and enjoy learning!
